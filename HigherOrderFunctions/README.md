# [Higher-order functions in Swift](https://betterprogramming.pub/higher-order-functions-in-swift-13c31a769c0c)

**Higher-order functions** are functions that take other functions or closures as arguments and that return a function or a closure. These functions are used with **arrays**, **sets**, and **dictionaries** and act on the elements they contain (this is done by methods that are applied to the elements of the collection using the point syntax).

Some of the best-known functions are *map*, *flatMap*, *compactMap*, *reduce*, *filter*, *contains*, *sort*, *sorted*, *forEach*, and *removeAll*.
